Creating a Starter Project Template in Flutter
In this project, I created a reusable Flutter starter template to streamline app development. I set up a clean project structure with separate folders for models, screens, widgets, and services. I also added essential files like theme.dart for styling and routes.dart for navigation. For state management, I integrated Provider, set up a basic UI, and included a simple network service template for handling API requests. This template helps me quickly start new projects with a consistent, organized structure.
